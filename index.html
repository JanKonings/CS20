        This picture is taken <br /> 
        in the middle of the Ski <br />
        Santa Fe ski resort. I <br />
        grew up skiing here my <br />
        whole life, and its one <br />
        of my favourite and most <br />
        memorable places in the <br />
        world. I have so many <br />
        great memories there and <br />
        I learned everything I <br />
        can do on skis at this resort.

    Something people might not expect about     <br />
    me is that I love sewing. I enjoy thrifting    <br />
    and then customizing pieces into what I  <br />
    like with my sewing machine.
